      estimates its quarterly operating profit was about 10.8tn won ($7.6bn;
      Â£6.9bn). On Thursday, US chip maker Advanced Micro Devices
      <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">(AMD)</span> also said
      it was hit by a fall in demand for computers. It comes as people cut back
      on purchases as the cost of living rises. Samsung's profits from its
      microprocessor making business suffered as the global price of memory
      chips plunged due to weakening demand for consumer electronics. <br />
      The estimates, which are for the three months to the end of September,
      mark Samsung's first year-on-year decline in quarterly profits in almost
      three years.
